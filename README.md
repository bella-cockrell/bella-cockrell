### Hi there 👋

I'm Bella Cockrell and, full-time, I work as an editor for a publishing company. I moonlight as a frontend dev and what I love about programming is that I'm constantly training the ol' wetware -- the world of tech is <strong>huge</strong> and I can't wait to learn more about it.

<ul>
<li>🔭 I’m currently working on a <a href='https://github.com/bella-cockrell/mars-weather-app'>weather app for Mars</a> and <a href='https://github.com/bella-cockrell/exercise-tracker'>an exercise tracker</a>.</li>
<li>🌱 I’m currently learning some backend jazz for my frontend projects; Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB.</li>
<li>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on websites with beautiful design and compelling animations and interaction.</li>
<li>🤔 I’m looking for help with learning more React hooks and any fun, new esoteric languages!</li>
<li>💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
