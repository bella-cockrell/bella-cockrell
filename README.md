## I'm Bella Cockrell👋 

Hi there and welcome to my GitHub! Here you'll find a various selection of projects I have started (and I daren't say how many I've completed). Most of the time, you'll find me moonlighting as a frontend dev and some technologies I love working with are React.JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Figma for my prototypes! At the moment, I'm currently trying to expand my horizons by exploring some backend technologies. 

What I love about programming is that I'm constantly training the ol' wetware -- the world of tech is <strong>huge</strong> and I can't wait to learn more about it. The community is phenomenal and so supportive -- either online or face to face and I can't wait to become good enough to teach others, to help give something back for all the lessons and code reviews.
